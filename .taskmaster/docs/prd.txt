# Overview  
Lattice is a small, pure, statically-typed functional language (Hindleyâ€“Milner inference, algebraic data types, algebraic effects with handlers) that targets WebAssembly in both server (Wasmtime) and browser environments. It solves the problem of having a modern, type-safe functional language that can run efficiently in web and server contexts without requiring complex runtime dependencies. The language is designed for developers who want strong type safety, functional programming paradigms, and WASM deployment capabilities in a single, cohesive language.

# Core Features  
- **Hindley-Milner Type System**: Provides powerful type inference and static type checking, eliminating runtime type errors and enabling better tooling support
- **Algebraic Data Types**: Supports pattern matching and immutable data structures for safer, more predictable code
- **Algebraic Effects with Handlers**: Enables clean separation of concerns and composable side effects without breaking referential transparency
- **WASM Compilation**: Generates efficient WebAssembly modules that can run in browsers and servers
- **Pure Functional Design**: Ensures referential transparency and makes code easier to test, reason about, and optimize
- **Package Management**: Built-in package manager for dependency management and project scaffolding

# User Experience  
**Primary User Personas:**
- Functional programming enthusiasts who want WASM deployment
- Web developers seeking type safety and functional paradigms
- Backend developers who want to share code between server and client
- Language researchers and compiler developers

**Key User Flows:**
1. Package Creation: Use `lattice-pm init` to create new projects
2. Development: Write Lattice code with full type inference and checking
3. Compilation: Use `lattice-compiler build` to generate WASM modules
4. Deployment: Deploy WASM modules to web browsers or server environments

**UI/UX Considerations:**
- Command-line focused for maximum flexibility and automation
- Clear error messages with type information
- Minimal boilerplate for common patterns
- Fast compilation times for iterative development

# Technical Architecture  
**System Components:**
- `lattice-compiler`: Rust-based compiler that parses Lattice source and emits WASM
- `lattice-pm`: Package manager for project initialization and dependency management
- `stdlib`: Standard library with prelude and core type definitions
- WASM output with host-GC integration and RC runtime fallback

**Data Models:**
- Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with type annotations
- Intermediate Representation (IR) for optimization
- WASM module structure with custom sections for Lattice-specific features

**APIs and Integrations:**
- WASM standard for browser compatibility
- Wasmtime integration for server-side execution
- Standard library primitives for common operations

**Infrastructure Requirements:**
- Rust toolchain for compiler development
- WASM target support in build pipeline
- CI/CD for automated testing and deployment

# Development Roadmap  
**Phase 1: Foundation (MVP)**
- Implement basic parser for Lattice syntax
- Create typed AST with Hindley-Milner inference
- Build minimal WASM code generation
- Establish basic standard library types (Bool, Option, Result, List)
- Implement simple function compilation and calling

**Phase 2: Language Completeness**
- Add algebraic data type support with pattern matching
- Implement algebraic effects system with handlers
- Expand standard library with practical utilities
- Add proper error handling and reporting
- Implement module system and imports

**Phase 3: Production Readiness**
- Optimize WASM output for size and performance
- Add comprehensive testing framework
- Implement package registry and dependency resolution
- Create development tools (REPL, debugger, profiler)
- Add documentation generation

**Phase 4: Ecosystem Development**
- Build comprehensive standard library
- Create example applications and tutorials
- Develop IDE integrations and language servers
- Establish community guidelines and contribution workflows

# Logical Dependency Chain  
**Foundation First (Phase 1):**
- Parser must be built before AST can be created
- Type inference system must be implemented before code generation
- Basic WASM emission must work before advanced optimizations

**Quick Path to Usable Frontend:**
- Focus on getting a simple "Hello World" WASM module working
- Ensure the compiler can process basic Lattice syntax
- Create minimal but functional standard library

**Progressive Enhancement:**
- Start with simple function compilation, then add pattern matching
- Begin with basic types, then expand to complex algebraic types
- Implement effects system after core language features are stable
- Add package management features incrementally

**Atomic Feature Development:**
- Each language feature should be independently implementable
- Compiler stages should be modular and testable
- Standard library functions should be composable and reusable

# Risks and Mitigations  
**Technical Challenges:**
- **Risk**: Implementing Hindley-Milner inference correctly
  - **Mitigation**: Start with simple type checking, add inference incrementally
- **Risk**: WASM code generation complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Begin with minimal WASM output, optimize later
- **Risk**: Algebraic effects implementation complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Research existing implementations, start with simple cases

**MVP Definition:**
- **Risk**: Scope creep in early phases
  - **Mitigation**: Focus on core language features first, defer advanced features
- **Risk**: Over-engineering the initial implementation
  - **Mitigation**: Start with simple, working code, refactor as needed

**Resource Constraints:**
- **Risk**: Limited compiler development expertise
  - **Mitigation**: Leverage Rust ecosystem, focus on incremental learning
- **Risk**: Time constraints for complex language features
  - **Mitigation**: Prioritize essential features, use existing research and tools
