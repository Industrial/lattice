The LSP server should provide: Code completion, Go to definition, Find references, Hover information, and Diagnostics. Create editor plugins for popular editors: VS Code, Vim/Neovim, and Emacs. Implement syntax highlighting for Lattice code. The LSP server should reuse the compiler's parser and type checker for accuracy. Implement incremental compilation for better responsiveness. Add support for code formatting. The LSP server should provide helpful type information and documentation. Implement code actions for common refactorings. The editor plugins should be published to their respective marketplaces.",

The debugger should support: Setting breakpoints, Stepping through code, Inspecting variables, and Viewing the call stack. Implement source maps to map between WASM and Lattice source code. Create a command-line interface for the debugger. The debugger should work with both browser and server environments. Implement conditional breakpoints and watchpoints. Add support for debugging optimized code. The debugger should provide a good user experience with clear and helpful information.

Implement all utilities in a pure functional style using algebraic effects for side effects. Ensure all functions are well-documented with examples and type signatures. Implement property-based tests for all functions. The standard library should be efficient and well-optimized. Design the API to be consistent and intuitive.
