## Few-Shot Examples

### Example 1: SQL Injection Vulnerability
**Vulnerability Type**: SQL Injection
**Severity**: Critical
**Risk Score**: 9.5/10
**Description**: User input directly concatenated into SQL queries
**Code Location**: `src/auth/login.py:45`
**Attack Vector**: Malicious input in username/password fields
**Impact**: Unauthorized database access, data manipulation, potential data breach

**Vulnerable Code**:
```python
# BEFORE (Vulnerable)
def authenticate_user(username, password):
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}' AND password = '{password}'"
    result = db.execute(query)
    return result.fetchone()
```

**Secure Implementation**:
```python
# AFTER (Secure)
def authenticate_user(username, password):
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?"
    result = db.execute(query, (username, password))
    return result.fetchone()

# Even better with ORM
def authenticate_user(username, password):
    user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()
    if user and user.check_password(password):
        return user
    return None
```

**Remediation Steps**:
1. Replace string concatenation with parameterized queries
2. Implement input validation and sanitization
3. Use ORM frameworks when possible
4. Add security testing to CI/CD pipeline

### Example 2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
**Vulnerability Type**: Reflected XSS
**Severity**: High
**Risk Score**: 8.5/10
**Description**: User input reflected in HTML without proper encoding
**Code Location**: `src/templates/search_results.html:23`
**Attack Vector**: Malicious script in search query parameters
**Impact**: Session hijacking, data theft, malicious code execution

**Vulnerable Code**:
```html
<!-- BEFORE (Vulnerable) -->
<div class="search-results">
    <h2>Search Results for: <%= search_query %></h2>
    <!-- search_query directly embedded in HTML -->
</div>
```

**Secure Implementation**:
```html
<!-- AFTER (Secure) -->
<div class="search-results">
    <h2>Search Results for: <%- escapeHtml(search_query) %></h2>
    <!-- Proper HTML encoding applied -->
</div>

<!-- Alternative with framework auto-escaping -->
<div class="search-results">
    <h2>Search Results for: {{ search_query }}</h2>
    <!-- Framework automatically escapes by default -->
</div>
```

**Remediation Steps**:
1. Implement proper output encoding
2. Use framework auto-escaping features
3. Add Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
4. Validate and sanitize all user inputs
