**Implementation**: Kubernetes with multiple service versions

```yaml
# Blue-Green Deployment Configuration
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-blue
  labels:
    app: myapp
    version: blue
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
      version: blue
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
        version: blue
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: myapp:blue-v1.2.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 5
          periodSeconds: 10
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 15
          periodSeconds: 20

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp
    version: blue  # Switch to 'green' for new version
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  type: LoadBalancer
```

**Deployment Process**:
```bash
# Deploy new version (green)
kubectl apply -f app-green-deployment.yaml

# Wait for green deployment to be ready
kubectl rollout status deployment/app-green

# Switch traffic to green version
kubectl patch service app-service -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"green"}}}'

# Verify green deployment is working
kubectl get pods -l app=myapp,version=green

# Rollback to blue if issues occur
kubectl patch service app-service -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"blue"}}}'
```
