## Few-Shot Examples

### Example 1: Microservices vs Monolith Decision

**Decision**: Microservices architecture
**Rationale**: 
- High scalability requirements (100K+ users)
- Complex domain with multiple bounded contexts (orders, inventory, payments)
- Team autonomy and independent deployment needs
- Technology diversity requirements

**Architecture Pattern**:
```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   API Gateway   │    │  Order Service  │    │ Inventory Svc   │
│                 │◄──►│                 │◄──►│                 │
│ - Rate Limiting │    │ - Order Mgmt    │    │ - Stock Mgmt    │
│ - Auth          │    │ - Payment Int.  │    │ - Availability  │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
         │                       │                       │
         ▼                       ▼                       ▼
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│  User Service   │    │ Payment Service │    │ Notification Svc│
│                 │    │                 │    │                 │
│ - User Mgmt     │    │ - Payment Proc.│    │ - Email/SMS     │
│ - Profiles      │    │ - Refunds       │    │ - Notifications │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

### Example 2: Event-Driven Architecture

    def create_order(self, order_data):
        order = Order.create(order_data)
        
        # Publish events for downstream systems
        event_bus.publish(OrderCreatedEvent(
            order_id=order.id,
            user_id=order.user_id,
            total_amount=order.total_amount,
            timestamp=datetime.utcnow()
        ))
        
        return order

# Event Consumer
class InventoryService:
    @event_handler(OrderCreatedEvent)
    def handle_order_created(self, event):
        # Update inventory based on order
        self.update_stock(event.order_id, event.items)
        
        # Publish inventory updated event
        event_bus.publish(InventoryUpdatedEvent(
            order_id=event.order_id,
            inventory_changes=inventory_changes
        ))
