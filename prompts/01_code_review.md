- [ ] **Business Logic**: Verify alignment with requirements and specifications

### 3. **Performance Analysis**
- [ ] **Algorithm Efficiency**: Analyze time and space complexity
- [ ] **Resource Usage**: Identify memory leaks, excessive allocations, and I/O bottlenecks
- [ ] **Scalability**: Assess performance under load and with larger datasets
- [ ] **Optimization Opportunities**: Suggest specific performance improvements

### 4. **Security Review**
- [ ] **Input Sanitization**: Check for injection attacks and unsafe input handling
- [ ] **Authentication/Authorization**: Verify proper access control mechanisms
- [ ] **Data Protection**: Assess handling of sensitive information
- [ ] **Dependency Security**: Review third-party library security implications

### 5. **Architecture & Design**
- [ ] **Separation of Concerns**: Evaluate modularity and component boundaries
- [ ] **Design Patterns**: Assess appropriate use of design patterns and SOLID principles
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Analyze coupling, cohesion, and dependency management
- [ ] **Extensibility**: Consider future requirements and modification ease

### 6. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Assess adequacy of unit and integration tests
- [ ] **Test Quality**: Evaluate test design, readability, and maintainability
- [ ] **Mocking Strategy**: Review test isolation and dependency management
- [ ] **Test Data**: Assess quality and coverage of test scenarios

## Few-Shot Examples

### Example 1: Security Issue Identification
**Issue Found**: SQL Injection vulnerability in user input handling
**Severity**: Critical
**Impact**: Unauthorized database access, data manipulation
**Code Location**: `src/auth/login.py:45`
**Recommendation**: Use parameterized queries with SQLAlchemy ORM
**Code Example**: 
```python
# BEFORE (Vulnerable)
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}'"

# AFTER (Secure)
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username"
result = db.execute(query, {"username": username})
```

### Example 2: Performance Optimization
**Issue Found**: N+1 query problem in user list endpoint
**Severity**: High
**Impact**: Slow response times, high database load
**Code Location**: `src/api/users.py:78`
**Recommendation**: Implement eager loading with SQLAlchemy
**Code Example**:
```python
# BEFORE (N+1 queries)
users = User.query.all()
for user in users:
    print(user.profile.name)  # Additional query per user

# AFTER (Single query with join)
users = User.query.options(joinedload(User.profile)).all()
for user in users:
    print(user.profile.name)  # No additional queries
```

## Output Format

### Executive Summary
Provide a high-level assessment with:
- Overall code quality rating (1-10 scale with justification)
- Critical issues count and business impact
- Major improvement areas ranked by ROI
- Risk assessment and mitigation timeline

### Detailed Findings
For each identified issue, provide:

1. **Severity**: Critical/High/Medium/Low (with clear criteria)
2. **Category**: Quality/Performance/Security/Architecture/Testing
3. **Description**: Clear explanation with specific code references
4. **Impact**: Potential consequences, business risks, and user experience impact
5. **Recommendation**: Specific, actionable improvement suggestions with code examples
6. **Effort Estimate**: Implementation effort (Low/Medium/High)
7. **Priority Score**: 1-10 based on impact Ã— effort matrix

### Improvement Roadmap
- **Immediate Actions** (Next 1-2 weeks): Critical issues requiring immediate attention
- **Short-term** (Next 1-2 months): High-impact issues with medium effort
- **Long-term** (Next 3-6 months): Architectural improvements and technical debt reduction

## Self-Evaluation Questions
Before finalizing your review, ask yourself:

1. **Completeness**: Have I covered all major code quality dimensions?
2. **Specificity**: Are my recommendations specific and actionable?
3. **Evidence**: Do I have concrete examples to support each finding?
4. **Prioritization**: Are my recommendations properly prioritized by business impact?
5. **Actionability**: Can a developer implement my suggestions without additional research?

## Quality Standards
- **Evidence-based**: Support all findings with specific code examples and line numbers
- **Actionable**: Provide concrete, implementable recommendations with code snippets
- **Prioritized**: Focus on high-impact improvements first, with clear justification
- **Constructive**: Frame feedback positively while being direct about issues
- **Comprehensive**: Cover all aspects without being overwhelming
- **Measurable**: Include specific metrics and benchmarks where applicable

## Additional Considerations
