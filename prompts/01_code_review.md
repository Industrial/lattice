## Required Analysis Areas

### 1. **Code Quality Assessment**
- [ ] **Readability**: Evaluate naming conventions, code structure, and clarity
- [ ] **Complexity**: Analyze cyclomatic complexity and cognitive load
- [ ] **Documentation**: Assess inline comments, API documentation, and README quality
- [ ] **Consistency**: Check for consistent coding style and patterns

### 2. **Functional Correctness**
- [ ] **Logic Errors**: Identify potential bugs, edge cases, and error conditions
- [ ] **Input Validation**: Assess handling of invalid inputs and boundary conditions
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Evaluate error handling strategies and user experience
- [ ] **Business Logic**: Verify alignment with requirements and specifications

### 3. **Performance Analysis**
- [ ] **Algorithm Efficiency**: Analyze time and space complexity
- [ ] **Resource Usage**: Identify memory leaks, excessive allocations, and I/O bottlenecks
- [ ] **Scalability**: Assess performance under load and with larger datasets
- [ ] **Optimization Opportunities**: Suggest specific performance improvements

### 4. **Security Review**
- [ ] **Input Sanitization**: Check for injection attacks and unsafe input handling
- [ ] **Authentication/Authorization**: Verify proper access control mechanisms
- [ ] **Data Protection**: Assess handling of sensitive information
- [ ] **Dependency Security**: Review third-party library security implications

### 5. **Architecture & Design**
- [ ] **Separation of Concerns**: Evaluate modularity and component boundaries
- [ ] **Design Patterns**: Assess appropriate use of design patterns and SOLID principles
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Analyze coupling, cohesion, and dependency management
- [ ] **Extensibility**: Consider future requirements and modification ease

### 6. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Assess adequacy of unit and integration tests
- [ ] **Test Quality**: Evaluate test design, readability, and maintainability
- [ ] **Mocking Strategy**: Review test isolation and dependency management
- [ ] **Test Data**: Assess quality and coverage of test scenarios

## Output Format

### Executive Summary
Provide a high-level assessment with:
- Overall code quality rating (1-10 scale)
- Critical issues count
- Major improvement areas
- Risk assessment

### Detailed Findings
For each identified issue:
1. **Severity**: Critical/High/Medium/Low
2. **Category**: Quality/Performance/Security/Architecture/Testing
3. **Description**: Clear explanation of the issue
4. **Impact**: Potential consequences and risks
5. **Recommendation**: Specific, actionable improvement suggestions
6. **Code Example**: If applicable, provide corrected code snippets

### Improvement Roadmap
