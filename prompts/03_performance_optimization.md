**Bottleneck**: Linear search algorithm
**Solution**: Implement binary search with sorted data structure
**Implementation**:
```python
# BEFORE (O(n) complexity)
def slow_search(items, target):
    for i, item in enumerate(items):
        if item == target:
            return i
    return -1

# AFTER (O(log n) complexity)
def fast_search(items, target):
    left, right = 0, len(items) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if items[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif items[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1

# Usage: items must be sorted
sorted_items = sorted(original_items)
index = fast_search(sorted_items, target)
```

class Connection:
    def __init__(self):
        self.socket = socket.socket()
        self.connect()

def handle_request():
    conn = Connection()  # New object every time
    # ... use connection
    conn.close()

# AFTER (reuses objects from pool)
class ConnectionPool:
    def __init__(self, max_connections=100):
        self.pool = Queue(maxsize=max_connections)
        self._initialize_pool()
    
    def _initialize_pool(self):
        for _ in range(self.pool.maxsize):
            conn = Connection()
            self.pool.put(conn)
    
    def get_connection(self):
        return self.pool.get()
    
    def return_connection(self, conn):
        conn.reset()  # Reset connection state
        self.pool.put(conn)

# Usage
pool = ConnectionPool()
conn = pool.get_connection()
try:
    # ... use connection
    pass
finally:
