## Few-Shot Examples

### Example 1: Test-Driven Development (TDD) Implementation
**Testing Approach**: TDD for critical business logic
**Implementation**: Write tests before implementation
**Example**: User authentication service

```python
# BEFORE: Implementation without tests
class AuthService:
    def authenticate_user(self, username, password):
        # Complex authentication logic without tests
        if username == "admin" and password == "password123":
            return {"user_id": 1, "role": "admin"}
        return None

# AFTER: TDD approach with comprehensive tests
import pytest

class TestAuthService:
    def setup_method(self):
        self.auth_service = AuthService()
    
    def test_authenticate_valid_user(self):
        """Test successful authentication with valid credentials"""
        result = self.auth_service.authenticate_user("admin", "password123")
        assert result is not None
        assert result["user_id"] == 1
        assert result["role"] == "admin"
    
    def test_authenticate_invalid_user(self):
        """Test failed authentication with invalid credentials"""
        result = self.auth_service.authenticate_user("admin", "wrong_password")
        assert result is None
    
    def test_authenticate_empty_credentials(self):
        """Test authentication with empty credentials"""
        result = self.auth_service.authenticate_user("", "")
        assert result is None
    
    def test_authenticate_sql_injection_attempt(self):
        """Test authentication with SQL injection attempt"""
        malicious_input = "admin'; DROP TABLE users; --"
        result = self.auth_service.authenticate_user(malicious_input, "password")
        assert result is None

# Implementation follows test requirements
class AuthService:
    def authenticate_user(self, username, password):
        if not username or not password:
            return None
        
        # Sanitize inputs and implement secure authentication
        if self._validate_credentials(username, password):
            return self._get_user_info(username)
        return None
```

**Benefits**: 
- 100% test coverage for authentication logic

- Clear specification of expected behavior

### Example 2: Performance Testing Strategy
**Testing Requirement**: API endpoint must handle 1000 requests/second
**Strategy**: Comprehensive performance testing with multiple scenarios

```python
# Performance test using Locust
from locust import HttpUser, task, between

class APIUser(HttpUser):
    wait_time = between(1, 3)
    
    @task(3)
    def test_user_authentication(self):
        """Test user authentication endpoint performance"""
        response = self.client.post("/api/auth/login", json={
            "username": "test_user",
            "password": "test_password"
        })
        assert response.status_code == 200
    
    @task(1)
    def test_user_profile(self):
        """Test user profile endpoint performance"""
        response = self.client.get("/api/users/profile")
        assert response.status_code == 200

# Performance test configuration
class PerformanceTestConfig:
    def __init__(self):
        self.target_rps = 1000  # Target: 1000 requests per second
        self.test_duration = 300  # 5 minutes test duration
        self.ramp_up_time = 60   # 1 minute ramp-up
        self.peak_users = 500    # Maximum concurrent users
    
    def run_performance_test(self):
        """Execute performance test with defined parameters"""
        # Test scenarios
        scenarios = [
            {"name": "Baseline", "users": 100, "duration": 60},
            {"name": "Load", "users": 500, "duration": 120},
            {"name": "Stress", "users": 1000, "duration": 60},
            {"name": "Spike", "users": 2000, "duration": 30},
            {"name": "Recovery", "users": 100, "duration": 60}
        ]
        
        for scenario in scenarios:
            self._run_scenario(scenario)
```

**Performance Metrics**:
- Response Time: P95 < 200ms, P99 < 500ms
- Throughput: 1000+ requests/second
- Error Rate: < 0.1%
- Resource Usage: CPU < 80%, Memory < 85%
